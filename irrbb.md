Great, I’ll put together a step-by-step methodology for developing an IRRBB (Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book) model for a commercial bank, with a focus on regulatory compliance. This will include the three key modeling approaches: Economic Value of Equity (EVE), Net Interest Income (NII) sensitivity, and behavioral modeling.

I’ll provide detailed steps, from data preparation and assumptions to model calibration and validation, as well as references to Basel guidelines and best practices. I’ll let you know as soon as it’s ready.

# IRRBB Modeling Methodology for a Commercial Bank (Regulatory-Compliant)

## 1. Overview of Regulatory Requirements  
**Basel IRRBB Standards:** Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) is governed by Basel Committee standards under Pillar 2 (Supervisory Review) frameworks ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=1,as%20well%20as%20its%20supervision)) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=4,to%20be%20applied)). Banks are expected to identify, measure, monitor, and control IRRBB in line with regulatory principles. The Basel Committee’s 2016 IRRBB guidelines (BCBS 368) updated the 2004 principles and introduced more detailed expectations for shock scenarios, behavioral assumptions, internal validation, and disclosures ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Greater%20guidance%20has%20been,and%20models%20used%20for)) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Banks%20must%20disclose%2C%20among%20other,prescribed%20interest%20rate%20shock%20scenarios)). Regulators require banks to quantify IRRBB under both **Economic Value of Equity (∆EVE)** and **Net Interest Income (∆NII)** measures, and to disclose the impact of prescribed interest rate shocks on these metrics ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Banks%20must%20disclose%2C%20among%20other,prescribed%20interest%20rate%20shock%20scenarios)). In practice, banks must report the change in EVE and projected NII under specified shocks, as set out by Basel, to ensure transparency and comparability across institutions.

**Prescribed Shock Scenarios and Outlier Test:** Basel defines a set of standardized interest rate shock scenarios that banks should use for IRRBB assessment. There are **six prescribed shock scenarios** (for EVE measurement) to capture various yield curve shifts, and **two scenarios** (for NII measurement) focusing on parallel rate changes ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Annex%202%20The%20standardised%20interest,across%20jurisdictions%2C%20the%20six%20shock)). These scenarios include: (1) parallel up, (2) parallel down, (3) steepener (short-term rates down, long-term rates up), (4) flattener (short-term up, long-term down), (5) short-term up shock, and (6) short-term down shock ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=,short%20rates%20shock%20down)). Regulators calibrate the magnitude of these shocks per currency (e.g. a 200bp parallel shock for USD as of the 2016 standards) to reflect historically extreme rate movements ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Table%201,150%20100%20300%20150%20300)). Supervisors use the **“outlier test”** to identify banks with excessive IRRBB: if the worst-case ∆EVE under the prescribed shocks exceeds a threshold (15% of Tier 1 capital, per updated Basel guidance) the bank is flagged for potential supervisory action ([](http://ma.moodys.com/rs/961-KCJ-308/images/interest-rate-risk-in-the-banking-book-meeting-the-practical-challenges.pdf#:~:text=%C2%BB%20A%20stricter%20threshold%20for,stress%20scenarios%20relying%20on%20validated)). National regulators (e.g. EBA in the EU, OSFI in Canada) have adopted similar standards, emphasizing IRRBB as a material risk requiring rigorous management and possibly imposing Pillar 2 capital add-ons for high exposures.

**Pillar 2 and Governance Expectations:** Since IRRBB is treated under Pillar 2, banks are afforded flexibility in modeling but are expected to meet high standards of risk management. Basel principles require robust internal **governance** of IRRBB – with the Board or ALCO setting risk appetite limits, approving key assumptions, and regularly reviewing risk reports ([](http://ma.moodys.com/rs/961-KCJ-308/images/interest-rate-risk-in-the-banking-book-meeting-the-practical-challenges.pdf#:~:text=PRINCIPLE%202%3A%20GOVERNANCE%20Principle%202,importance%20of%20anticipation%20of%20specific)). Enhanced **disclosure** requirements (under Pillar 3) mean banks must regularly publish their ∆EVE and ∆NII under standard shocks, along with qualitative discussion of IRRBB management practices ([](http://ma.moodys.com/rs/961-KCJ-308/images/interest-rate-risk-in-the-banking-book-meeting-the-practical-challenges.pdf#:~:text=%C2%BB%20More%20extensive%20guidance%20on,common%20interest%20rate%20shock%20scenarios)). In summary, the regulatory framework mandates that banks develop comprehensive IRRBB models that capture both long-term value and short-term earnings risks, align with defined shock scenarios, and are supported by strong validation and governance processes.

## 2. Data Requirements and Sources  
**Balance Sheet Data:** Developing an IRRBB model requires detailed data on all interest-rate-sensitive positions in the banking book. This includes **loan and bond portfolios** (with their outstanding balances, interest rates or coupons, repricing dates or maturities, amortization schedules) and **deposit and liability products** (deposit balances, current rates paid, contractual terms such as maturity or notice period, and any embedded optionality like early withdrawal features). Each instrument’s cash flow schedule (principal and interest payments over time) should be obtained or generated. Typically, data is sourced from core banking systems, treasury systems, and financial reporting systems to cover the full balance sheet. Positions should be segmented by currency since IRRBB is assessed per currency; for each currency, you need the relevant yield curves for valuation and scenario analysis.

**Market Data:** IRRBB modeling relies on external market data to derive discount rates and scenario shifts. Key market data includes the **risk-free yield curves** for each currency (e.g. overnight index swap or government bond curves) to compute present values under EVE, and forward rates for projecting future interest revenues under NII simulations. Historical interest rate data is needed to calibrate shock magnitudes and to analyze behavioral responses (e.g. how customers reacted to past rate changes). For behavioral models, additional macroeconomic data (inflation, unemployment, housing prices, etc.) can be relevant as drivers of customer behavior (for example, prepayment rates or deposit attrition might correlate with economic conditions ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=other%20historical%20factors,be%20considered%20in%20modelling%20prepayment)) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=competitive%20environment%2C%20remaining%20maturity%20and,location%20and%20demographic%20and%20other))).

**Data Infrastructure and Quality:** A robust data infrastructure (data warehouse or risk data mart) is essential to aggregate and retrieve all necessary data for IRRBB calculations. Basel principles stress that a bank’s MIS should capture **all material IRRBB exposures** and that data handling be automated and controlled ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=54,in%20the%20bank%E2%80%99s%20risk%20measurement)) ([Interest Rate Risk Management - Guideline (2019) - Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions](https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/en/guidance/guidance-library/interest-rate-risk-management-guideline-2019#:~:text=timely%20manner,the%20institution%27s%20risk%20measurement%20process)). Key data elements (balance sheet records, customer behavioral data, yield curves) should be subject to validation and reconciliation with accounting figures to ensure accuracy. **Data mapping** (linking products to modeling categories or time buckets) should be documented and periodically tested ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=documentation%20of%20the%20major%20data,eg%20for%20gap)). Banks should aim to automate data feeds as much as possible to reduce manual errors, and implement edit checks or exceptions reporting for data integrity ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=documentation%20of%20the%20major%20data,or%20assigned%20to)). Common data sources include: core banking databases (for customer and account data), data vendors (for market rates), and internal data collected from finance and risk departments (for assumptions and model parameters). Ensuring a **stable and consistent data schema** over time is important so that risk metrics can be compared period-to-period without being skewed by data definition changes ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=56,risk%20figures%20over%20different%20periods)). All major data sources and transformations used in the IRRBB model should be documented for transparency and auditability ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=54,in%20the%20bank%E2%80%99s%20risk%20measurement)).

## 3. Key Modeling Assumptions and Dependencies  
Developing an IRRBB model requires several **key assumptions** to deal with uncertain or behavioral aspects of the balance sheet. These assumptions must be **conceptually sound, documented, and regularly reviewed** in line with regulatory expectations ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=should%20be%20fully%20understood%2C%20conceptually,explicit%20and%20embedded)) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=50,and%20more%20frequently%20during%20rapidly)). Below are the primary assumptions to establish:

- **Interest Rate Options Exercise:** Many banking book items contain embedded options. Assumptions are needed for how these options will be exercised under different rate scenarios. For example, borrowers may prepay loans when rates fall, or depositors might withdraw to seek higher yields when rates rise. The IRRBB model should include expectations for the exercise of such options by customers and the bank itself under each shock or stress scenario ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=number%20of%20assumptions%20made%20for,of%20accounting%20practices%20for%20IRRBB)) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=45,There%20are%20several%20factors)). This covers explicit options (like loan prepayment clauses or caps/floors on loans) and implicit behavioral options (like the ability of depositors to withdraw on-demand).

- **Loan Prepayment Speeds:** For fixed-rate loans (e.g. mortgages) subject to prepayment risk, an assumption about the **Conditional Prepayment Rate (CPR)** or similar metric is required. Banks should make **reasonable and prudent estimates of expected prepayment speeds**, considering factors such as loan type, seasoning (age of loan), interest rate incentives, and borrower characteristics ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=45,There%20are%20several%20factors)) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Product%20Dimensions%20influencing%20the%20exercise,stock%20indices%2C%20unemployment%20rates%2C%20GDP)). The assumptions must consider how prepayment behavior changes in different interest rate environments. Typically, the model will assume **faster prepayments when interest rates decline** (as customers refinance or prepay to benefit from lower rates) and **slower prepayments when rates rise** ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=123,of%20each%20loan%20in%20the)). For instance, Basel’s standard approach suggests applying multipliers to base prepayment rates (e.g. 120% of the baseline CPR in a downward shock, 80% in an upward shock) to reflect these behavioral tendencies ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=123,of%20each%20loan%20in%20the)). Any prepayment penalties or contractual constraints that limit prepayment should also be factored into the assumptions and documented ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=nature%20of%20prepayment%20risk%20for,of%20the%20effect%20of%20each)).

- **Non-Maturity Deposit (NMD) Behavior:** Deposits with no contractual maturity (e.g. checking and savings accounts) require assumptions on both **balance stickiness (decay)** and **rate paid (pricing)**. Since customers can withdraw at any time, their contractual maturity is overnight, but in practice these deposits exhibit significant stickiness and behave as if they have an effective maturity ([Finalyse: Non-Maturity Deposit Modelling](https://www.finalyse.com/blog/non-maturity-deposit-modelling#:~:text=Non,have%20a%20significant%20effective%20duration)). Banks should analyze their depositor base to determine the proportion of “core” deposits – the stable portion unlikely to run off even under interest rate changes – versus “volatile” deposits that are more sensitive ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=behaviour%20used%20in%20their%20IMS,transactional)). **Core deposit** balances can be assigned an assumed maturity or repricing profile (often spread over a few years) to reflect their stable behavior, while volatile deposits are modeled to reprice or withdraw quickly. Regulatory guidance expects banks to **document, monitor, and regularly update** these NMD assumptions, varying them by depositor characteristics (retail vs wholesale, transactional vs non-transactional accounts, etc.) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=should%20analyse%20its%20depositor%20base,transactional)). Another key assumption is the **deposit rate pass-through (beta)** – i.e., how much and how quickly the bank will raise or lower the interest rates paid to depositors in response to market rate changes. This affects NII projections significantly. Sound practice is to segment deposit portfolios and assign a beta for each (for example, checking accounts might have a low beta, meaning the rate paid changes little even if market rates move, whereas money-market accounts have a higher beta). These betas should be grounded in historical analysis of deposit rate changes and competitive dynamics ([
	Considerations for Interest Rate Risk Modeling in an Elevated Rate Environment
](https://www.communitybankingconnections.org/Articles/2024/R1/interest-rate-risk-modeling#:~:text=assumptions%20and%20ensure%20their%20reasonableness,projecting%20deposit%20betas%20by%20product)). In summary, NMD modeling assumptions cover how long deposits stay (decay rates) and how their pricing behaves (rate elasticity); both are crucial and should be empirically supported and stress-tested.

- **Term Deposit Early Redemptions:** For time deposits (fixed-term CDs) that have contractual maturities, some may allow early withdrawal (possibly with a penalty). The model should assume a certain fraction of customers will break their term deposits early if it’s economically favorable (for example, if market rates rise well above the deposit’s fixed rate, more withdrawals might occur despite penalties). Basel guidelines advise classifying which term deposits are considered prone to early redemption and applying appropriate estimates of early redemption rates, with documentation of any assumed penalties or restrictions ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=,redemption%20penalties%20or%20to%20other)). These assumptions ensure that optionality in term funding is captured in both EVE (by adjusting effective maturity) and NII (by projecting potential runoff).

- **Loan Commitments and Pipeline:** Many banks offer loan rate locks or commitments (e.g. mortgage commitments where a borrower can draw down a loan at a fixed rate in the near future). These are essentially options granted to customers. Assumptions are needed for **pipeline pull-through rates** – i.e., what percentage of committed loans will actually be drawn, and how this might change with rates. If rates rise, fewer borrowers might exercise their option (for fixed-rate commitments), whereas if rates fall, more will exercise. The IRRBB model should incorporate a reasonable drawdown rate under each scenario ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=interest%20rate%20shock%20and%20stress,loan%20commitments%20to%20corporates%2C%20where)). This ensures off-balance-sheet exposures that can become on-balance-sheet in adverse scenarios are accounted for.

- **Own Equity Treatment:** In EVE calculations, one modeling choice is how to treat the bank’s own non-interest-bearing equity and capital. Since equity has no contractual maturity, some banks assign a “replicating portfolio” or an assumed duration to equity (often treating a portion of equity as a very long-term funding to balance long-term assets). Others might exclude equity from the EVE sensitivity calculation altogether (since it does not reprice). Basel allows flexibility but requires that whatever approach is taken (if equity is treated as part of the investable balance sheet in EVE) it should be conservative and clearly documented ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20treatment%20of%20balances%20and,terms%20because%20of%20behavioural%20optionalities)). For instance, assuming an unrealistic long duration for equity to soak up IRRBB could understate risk, so banks often cap the maturity assigned to equity (e.g. equity invested in assets with a duration of maybe 5 years for modeling purposes). The **implications of accounting classifications** (e.g. fair value through OCI vs amortized cost) on EVE should also be considered ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20treatment%20of%20balances%20and,terms%20because%20of%20behavioural%20optionalities)), since some capital instruments’ values may or may not be recognized in earnings or capital immediately when rates move.

All these assumptions should be **tested and understood** by management. Basel Principle 5 specifically states that banks must rigorously assess how changes in interest rates impact these behavioral assumptions and document the reasoning ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=should%20be%20fully%20understood%2C%20conceptually,explicit%20and%20embedded)) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Hence%2C%20when%20assessing%20its%20IRRBB,understand%20the%20nature%20of%20prepayment)). It’s good practice to perform **sensitivity analysis on assumptions** – for example, what if deposit outflows are 10% faster than assumed, or prepayments 20% higher? – to see the impact on EVE and NII results ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=perform%20sensitivity%20analyses%20for%20key,should%20also%20include%20descriptions%20on)). Assumptions should be grounded in empirical analysis (historical observations, customer surveys, competitive benchmarking) but also incorporate expert judgment for future conditions. They should be reviewed at least annually and updated as market conditions or customer behaviors evolve ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=51,smaller%20reductions%20in%20interest%20rates)). Thorough **documentation** of each assumption is required, including rationale, data sources, and any expert adjustments, so that validators and supervisors can understand how the model reflects the bank’s IRRBB profile ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=50,and%20more%20frequently%20during%20rapidly)).

## 4. Economic Value of Equity (EVE) Modeling Approach  
**Concept and Purpose:** The Economic Value of Equity approach measures the *long-term risk* to the bank’s capital due to interest rate changes. It does so by looking at the *present value of future cash flows* of assets and liabilities. Essentially, EVE is the net present value (NPV) of the banking book (assets minus liabilities, including off-balance-sheet items) – this NPV is a proxy for the economic value of the bank’s equity. An interest rate shock will cause the present values of fixed-rate or rate-sensitive instruments to change, thus changing the EVE. EVE is a **point-in-time** economic measure, in contrast to NII which is a period income measure. In regulatory terms, EVE captures the sensitivity of the bank’s value to rate movements, reflecting the risk of future earnings beyond the short-term horizon ([Interest Rate Risk Management - Guideline (2019) - Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions](https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/en/guidance/guidance-library/interest-rate-risk-management-guideline-2019#:~:text=,therefore%20do%20not%20fully%20capture)).

**Run-off Balance Sheet Assumption:** Typically, the EVE calculation is done under a *run-off* assumption, meaning we take the existing balance sheet and allow all cash flows to run off according to their contractual (or modeled behavioral) terms, without assuming any new business ([Interest Rate Risk Management - Guideline (2019) - Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions](https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/en/guidance/guidance-library/interest-rate-risk-management-guideline-2019#:~:text=focus%20on%20changes%20to%20future,measures%20consider%20the%20net%20present)) ([Interest Rate Risk Management - Guideline (2019) - Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions](https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/en/guidance/guidance-library/interest-rate-risk-management-guideline-2019#:~:text=,Footnote%2010)). This isolates the risk in the current portfolio. Each instrument’s cash flows are projected out to maturity (adjusted for assumed prepayments or early withdrawals as discussed) and discounted back to today using the appropriate discount rates. By subtracting the PV of liabilities from the PV of assets, we get the base-case EVE. Then, under a shock scenario, we re-value all those instruments with the shocked yield curve(s) to get a shocked EVE. The change ∆EVE is the metric of interest – it represents how much the economic value of equity would drop or increase under that rate scenario.

**Valuation and Methodology:** To implement the EVE model:  
- **Cash Flow Generation:** Using product data, generate cash flow schedules for each asset and liability. For floating-rate instruments, the model might assume they reprice fully at the next reset date (so only cash flows until next reset are fixed, thereafter they follow new rates). For fixed-rate instruments, all future fixed cash flows are taken. Apply behavioral assumptions: e.g., for mortgages with prepayment, the cash flow schedule should include expected prepayments (which shorten the effective maturity); for deposits, core deposits might be slotted into longer dated cash flow buckets according to assumed repricing maturity. Off-balance-sheet items like interest rate swaps (used as hedges) should also be included in the cash flow set. 
- **Discounting:** Choose discount rates appropriate for each cash flow. A common approach is to use the current risk-free (swap) yield curve plus a liquidity spread if needed. Under shocks, the yield curve is shifted according to the scenario (see section 6). The present value (PV) of each instrument (or each cash flow bucket) is calculated as the sum of discounted cash flows. Assets and liabilities are usually discounted with the same yield curve in standardized measures (assuming parallel shifts to risk-free curve). Some advanced models might use different discount curves for different instruments (e.g., incorporating credit spreads for loans) for internal management, but regulatory EVE focuses on interest rate risk in isolation.
- **Aggregation:** Sum the PV of all asset cash flows and liability cash flows. The difference is EVE. In shock scenarios, this difference will change. The model often computes ∆EVE as Shocked EVE minus baseline EVE (or vice versa). A large negative ∆EVE under an upward shock, for example, indicates the bank’s economic value drops when rates rise (commonly due to having long-term fixed-rate assets funded by shorter liabilities).

**Capture of Optionality:** Within the EVE model, it’s critical to incorporate optionality effects. For instance, if customers can prepay loans, an interest rate rise might reduce prepayment (extending the asset’s duration, making the asset more sensitive and thus EVE more negative). The model should either embed these options in the cash flow simulation (e.g., via option-adjusted spread or scenario-dependent cash flows) or measure them separately. Often, banks perform **value-at-risk type analyses or option sensitivity analysis** for instruments with optionality (like caps/floors on loans or callable bonds) and include those in EVE. Basel’s standardized approach, for example, adds an *option risk* component to ∆EVE for automatic options like caps/floors ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Stage%203,prescribed%20interest%20rate%20shock%20scenarios)). In an internal model, one can simulate different rate paths or use option pricing models to estimate the option’s value change under the shock.

**Regulatory EVE Calculation:** Per Basel guidance, banks using internal models should calculate EVE changes for each major currency under each of the six prescribed shock scenarios ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Annex%202%20The%20standardised%20interest,across%20jurisdictions%2C%20the%20six%20shock)). Usually, the “worst” (most adverse) scenario ∆EVE for each currency is taken, and then those are aggregated (often simply summed, ignoring any diversification benefit unless allowed by the supervisor). The reported ∆EVE is typically this worst-case loss in economic value. The bank should compare this against its Tier 1 capital to assess the severity (the outlier test as noted). **Example:** Suppose under a 200bp up parallel shock, the bank’s EVE declines by 10%, and under a 200bp down shock, EVE increases by 5%. The ∆EVE reported might be -10% (because that’s the largest decline). If 10% of Tier 1 is below the 15% threshold, it’s within norms; if it exceeded 15%, supervisors may scrutinize further ([](http://ma.moodys.com/rs/961-KCJ-308/images/interest-rate-risk-in-the-banking-book-meeting-the-practical-challenges.pdf#:~:text=%C2%BB%20A%20stricter%20threshold%20for,stress%20scenarios%20relying%20on%20validated)).

**Insight from EVE:** The EVE approach is a **long-term sensitivity** measure – it captures all future earnings changes in NPV form. It effectively assumes the change in economic value will eventually impact capital (as future earnings or losses). EVE is very useful for structural risk management: it shows the impact on the bank’s net worth from rate changes, highlighting mismatch in long-dated positions. However, EVE does not show the timing of earnings impacts – a large EVE drop might materialize over many years. That’s why it’s complemented by the NII approach ([Interest Rate Risk Management - Guideline (2019) - Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions](https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/en/guidance/guidance-library/interest-rate-risk-management-guideline-2019#:~:text=For%20risk%20management%20purposes%2C%20institutions,in%20particular%20in%20terms%20of)). Nonetheless, managing IRRBB often starts with setting limits on ∆EVE (e.g., limit ∆EVE to no more than, say, 10% of capital for a 200bp shock) as a key risk appetite metric. 

In building the EVE model, it is important to ensure **data accuracy** (any small error in large cash flow projections can skew EVE) and to **validate the discounting approach** (e.g., whether using yield curves correctly). Also, **basis risk** (different reference rates moving differently) should be considered: if assets are tied to one index and liabilities to another, a parallel shift assumption may not capture losses from their divergence. Advanced EVE models break down exposure by rate indices to measure basis risk as well.

## 5. Net Interest Income (NII) Sensitivity Modeling Approach  
**Concept and Purpose:** The Net Interest Income approach measures the *short to medium-term* impact of interest rate changes on the bank’s earnings. Rather than present values, it simulates the bank’s **accrual earnings** over a future horizon (commonly 1 year and sometimes 2-3 years) under different interest rate scenarios. It addresses how rate changes will affect the bank’s interest income from assets and interest expense on liabilities, thereby changing the net interest margin. This is crucial because even if economic value is stable, a bank could face earnings pressure in the near term, which affects reported profits and possibly dividend capacity. EVE and NII are complementary – EVE is about *value* over the full life, NII is about *income* over the next quarters ([Interest Rate Risk Management - Guideline (2019) - Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions](https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/en/guidance/guidance-library/interest-rate-risk-management-guideline-2019#:~:text=,therefore%20do%20not%20fully%20capture)).

**Horizon and Balance Sheet Assumptions:** Regulators typically ask for a **12-month NII sensitivity** as a standard measure ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=,assumption%20and%20an%20instantaneous%20shock)). The bank projects its net interest income over the next year (or year-by-year for multi-year analysis) under a baseline scenario (assuming current yield curve and business mix) and then under shock scenarios. The difference is ∆NII. A **constant balance sheet** assumption is generally used for the regulatory NII measure ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=,assumption%20and%20an%20instantaneous%20shock)). This means that as assets or liabilities mature within the horizon, they are replaced with similar instruments (in terms of amount and type) so that the overall size and mix of the portfolio remains the same. This isolates the effect of interest rate changes on income, without introducing changes in volume or mix. (It’s essentially saying: “if our book stays as is, how does NII change when rates move?”). Under the constant balance sheet assumption, **no new growth** is assumed beyond replacing runoff, and it is also assumed the bank’s strategy in terms of pricing new loans/deposits is consistent with current one. Alternatively, some banks may explore a **run-off NII** (where maturing positions are not replaced, so the balance sheet shrinks) or a **dynamic NII** (which factors in business plan changes), but those are more for internal use. The Basel standard specifically prescribes a 12-month horizon, constant balance sheet, and instantaneous shock for the disclosed ∆NII ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=,assumption%20and%20an%20instantaneous%20shock)).

**Projection Mechanics:** To compute NII under different scenarios:  
- **Starting Point:** Use the current repricing gaps or interest rate terms of the portfolio. Essentially, classify assets and liabilities by their next *repricing date*. For floating-rate instruments, repricing is their rate reset (e.g., a loan tied to 3-month LIBOR will reprice in 3 months). For fixed-rate, repricing is at maturity (unless prepayment occurs sooner per assumptions).
- **Interest Rate Scenarios:** For the scenarios (e.g., +200bp shock, -200bp shock), adjust the yield curve immediately (an instantaneous shock). Then derive implied new coupon rates for any instrument that will reprice during the horizon. For example, under a +200bp parallel shock, when a loan reaches its reset date, its rate is reset 200bp higher than it would have otherwise been. For new volumes (to replace maturing ones under constant balance sheet), assume the same new business rate. Typically, the baseline scenario might assume the current yield curve stays unchanged (or follows some expected path), while the shocked scenario uses the shocked curve from day 1 onward.
- **Calculate NII:** Project interest income and interest expense for each future period (e.g., monthly or quarterly over the year) by applying the scenario rates. For assets and liabilities that do not reprice within the horizon, their interest cash flows remain the same as current in both scenarios (so no impact on NII in the short term). For those that do reprice (or new originations replacing maturities), use the new rate. Include assumptions on **deposit rate pass-through** (e.g., in an upward shock, maybe the bank will only raise savings account rates by 50bps even if market rates rise 200bps, reflecting a beta of 0.25). These pricing assumptions significantly affect NII results. Also include any hedges’ cash flows – e.g., if the bank has interest rate swaps, the interest paid/received on those swaps under the new rates must be factored in.
- **Net Interest Income and Sensitivity:** Sum all interest income and subtract interest expense over the horizon to get NII under baseline and under shock. The difference ∆NII can be expressed in absolute terms or as a percentage of baseline NII. Regulators often focus on the two standard scenarios (parallel up and parallel down shocks) for ∆NII ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Banks%20should%20apply%20six%20prescribed,across%20jurisdictions%2C%20the%20six%20shock)). For example, a bank might report that a +200bp shock would cause a -5% change in next 12-month NII, whereas a -200bp shock causes a -2% change (some banks actually lose income in both directions if they are asset-sensitive in one range but hit floored assets in negative shocks, etc.).

**Multi-Period and Dynamic Considerations:** Although the one-year static measure is required, banks often extend the analysis to multiple years and consider business plans. A **two-year NII** projection can highlight timing differences (maybe the first year NII is positive under a shock because liabilities reprice faster, but by second year assets reprice and catch up). **Dynamic NII modeling** incorporates assumptions about how the bank would act: for example, would it actively change its product pricing or strategy if rates changed? Would volumes grow or shift (customer behavior changes)? Dynamic modeling blurs into stress testing and is often used in internal capital planning. However, it introduces many additional assumptions, so for regulatory consistency the static approach is preferred for the standardized metric ([Interest Rate Risk Management - Guideline (2019) - Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions](https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/en/guidance/guidance-library/interest-rate-risk-management-guideline-2019#:~:text=,Footnote%2010)). Banks may run a range of scenarios in NII models (not just the standardized shocks) for internal risk management, such as gradual rate changes, forward-looking yield curve forecasts, etc., to understand earnings at risk under various conditions.

**Capture of Products and Optionality in NII:** All **interest rate-sensitive instruments** should be included. Non-maturity deposits are a special case: under NII, one must project how deposit balances might shift (which usually under constant balance sheet we keep total balance constant but could reallocate between core/volatile if modeling that detail) and how deposit rates adjust. A *high-level approach* might be: assume the bank will reprice its deposit products at certain betas and that no significant runoff of core deposits occurs in the 1-year scenario (unless doing a stress where you assume outflows). For **loans with prepayment options**, the NII model should reflect any increase in prepayments when rates drop (which would reduce interest income as loans pay off faster and cash is reinvested at lower rates) or decrease in prepayments when rates rise (loans stick around yielding below-market rates, potentially reducing income vs new business). This can be complex; some banks simplify by not dynamically adjusting portfolio composition within 1 year for prepayments (if the horizon is short, the effect may be minor), while others do adjust the average balance of loans for expected prepayment changes. **Caps and floors** on floating rates will also impact NII: e.g., if rates rise but a loan has a cap, beyond that cap the loan’s rate income won’t increase further, so NII under a big upward shock might plateau.

**Regulatory Focus:** Basel’s IRRBB standards ask for the 12-month ∆NII under the two prescribed shocks (parallel up and down) to be disclosed ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Banks%20should%20apply%20six%20prescribed,across%20jurisdictions%2C%20the%20six%20shock)). The measure is typically computed **assuming a constant balance sheet and an instantaneous rate shock** ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=,assumption%20and%20an%20instantaneous%20shock)). Banks should be mindful of any **flooring** in scenarios (e.g., if the shock would produce negative interest rates, some banks floor deposit rates at 0 or some lower bound – assumptions here should be consistent and conservative). Supervisors may also request to see alternative NII scenarios (e.g., gradual rate ramps, different yield curve shapes) as part of deeper examinations, but the headline metric is usually the instantaneous parallel shocks.

**Using NII Results:** The NII sensitivity informs management and regulators about short-term earnings risk. For example, if a bank has a large drop in NII for an upward shock, it indicates liability sensitivity (perhaps many deposits will reprice up immediately while loan yields lag). That might prompt the bank to consider actions like hedging or rebalancing to protect earnings. It’s important that the NII model **aligns with the bank’s financial planning** – the baseline projection of NII (before shock) should tie out with the budget/forecast under prevailing rate expectations. Then the shock scenario shows deviation from that plan if rates surprise. Good practice is also to compute **earnings-at-risk** relative to equity or to expected profit: e.g., a 5% of equity drop in NII might be tolerable, but beyond that maybe not.

In summary, the NII approach requires carefully modeling how and when each product’s rate updates. Unlike EVE, which is largely about valuation math, NII modeling is closely tied to **behavioral and strategic assumptions** (like deposit repricing strategy, competitive pressure on loan rates, etc.). It provides a complementary view to EVE – while EVE might flag a big long-term risk, NII will tell you if you can “survive” the next year’s earnings under rate changes. Both should be used in tandem to manage IRRBB comprehensively ([Interest Rate Risk Management - Guideline (2019) - Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions](https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/en/guidance/guidance-library/interest-rate-risk-management-guideline-2019#:~:text=For%20risk%20management%20purposes%2C%20institutions,in%20particular%20in%20terms%20of)).

## 6. Behavioral Modeling Methodologies  
Accurate IRRBB measurement hinges on robust **behavioral models** for products where customer behavior can alter the bank’s interest rate exposure. Key areas are **non-maturity deposits (NMDs)** and **loan prepayments**, as well as other optionalities like **term deposit breakage** and **loan commitment drawdowns**. Here we outline methodologies to model these behaviors:

### 6.1 Non-Maturity Deposit (Core Deposit) Modeling  
**Segmentation into Core/Non-Core:** The common methodology is to segment NMDs into a “core” portion (stable, low-rate-sensitive balances) and a “non-core” portion (volatile or rate-sensitive). This is often done by analyzing historical balance patterns during different interest rate cycles. For example, a bank might observe that 60% of its retail savings accounts remain fairly stable even when rates move, while 40% tends to be more volatile (funds that flow out to higher-yield opportunities or are more seasonal). The **core portion** can then be assigned an assumed maturity profile (for EVE) – e.g., one might assume the core behaves like a 3-year liability (distributed across 1-5 year maturities to reflect a spread of repricing dates). The **non-core portion** is treated as overnight (reprices immediately with market rates). This segmentation should be data-driven: using statistical analysis or time-series decomposition to find the stable part of deposits. Some banks use **decay rate models** – estimating an average life of deposits by seeing how balances “decay” over time independent of new inflows.

**Deposit Decay and Average Life:** A quantitative way to model NMD balances is to compute a **decay rate** – the rate at which balances run off over time if no new money comes in. This can be derived from historical attrition analysis or during stress periods. If a deposit product has an annual decay rate of 20%, that implies an average life of about 5 years for that cohort of deposits. The model can then simulate an effective runoff of deposits: e.g., for EVE, instead of assuming perpetual life, you schedule outflows of deposits according to the decay curve. Regulators expect banks to understand how decay rates differ by account type and client segment ([

](https://www.communitybankingconnections.org/Articles/2024/R1/interest-rate-risk-modeling#:~:text=Developing%20an%20understanding%20of%20the,For%20example)). For instance, transaction accounts used for payroll might be stickier versus high-balance money market accounts of rate-sensitive customers. It’s important to periodically re-estimate decay rates, especially after significant rate changes or changes in customer behavior (for example, post-2022 rising rates, many banks saw faster runoff than during previous low-rate periods, indicating decay assumptions needed updating).

**Deposit Rate (Beta) Modeling:** Alongside volume behavior, modeling how banks will adjust deposit **interest rates** is critical for NII. A **deposit beta** measures the percentage of market rate changes that is passed on to customers. Modeling deposit pricing often involves examining historical data: e.g., when market rates (like Fed Funds or LIBOR) moved, how did the bank change its offered rates on savings, interest checking, money markets, etc.? Regression analysis can be used to estimate beta (change in product rate vs change in market rate) and any lags in adjustment. Many banks also incorporate competitive dynamics – e.g., if peers are raising rates faster, the bank might have to match to retain deposits. The behavioral model might set different betas for different ranges of rate change (perhaps near-zero rates to 1% have one beta, but beyond that, customers demand more). For example, a bank could assume a beta of 0.5 for money market accounts in an up-shock, meaning if market rates rise 200bps, it will raise these deposit rates by ~100bps. For sticky transaction accounts, maybe a beta of 0.1 (only 20bps increase for 200bps market move). These assumptions greatly affect NII projections and should be aligned with the bank’s pricing strategy and past behavior. **Stress testing** deposit betas is also wise – what if competition forces higher betas than assumed? This can be part of assumption sensitivity analysis.

**Regression and Covariate Models:** Some advanced banks employ multivariate models for deposit balances that include factors like **interest rate differential** (bank’s rate minus market rate), **customer demographics**, **macroeconomic indicators**, etc. For instance, a model may find that if the gap between market yield and savings rate increases by 1%, the bank loses X% of balances (funds move to alternatives). These models can be used to simulate balance outflows under rate scenarios. For simplicity, many institutions prefer segment-level rules (core vs volatile) rather than full dynamic simulation, but they should ensure those rules approximate reality. **Machine learning approaches** have also been tried to cluster customers by behavior (rate-sensitive vs convenience-driven depositors) to refine core deposit estimates.

**Validation of Deposit Models:** Behavioral deposit models need back-testing. If the bank had an assumption that 60% of deposits are core with 5-year life, did that hold true when rates actually moved? For example, in a rising rate environment, did balances behave as predicted or did more run off? Banks should compare model predictions to actual balance changes and recalibrate if needed. They should also consider **unusual conditions** – e.g., the possibility of rapid outflows if there’s a loss of confidence or better opportunities (this edges into liquidity risk, but there’s overlap). IRRBB specifically looks at value and earnings changes, so even if deposits don’t run off, if the bank ends up raising deposit rates much more than expected, that’s an earnings hit.

In summary, NMD modeling combines analysis of **balance stickiness (decay/core)** and **pricing (beta)**. The output typically is: for EVE – an effective maturity/duration assigned to core deposits; for NII – a projected path of deposit rates and balances under scenarios. These assumptions must be tailored to the bank (regulators caution against using generic industry assumptions that don’t reflect one’s own data ([

Documentation should detail how core proportions were determined, what historical period was used, and how the model behaves under extreme rate changes.

### 6.2 Loan Prepayment Modeling  
**Drivers of Prepayment:** Prepayment modeling focuses primarily on retail loans like mortgages, but also any fixed-rate loans where borrowers can repay early (often with little or no penalty). Key drivers include the **interest rate incentive** (difference between the borrower’s current rate and prevailing market rates), **borrower credit quality** (can they refinance easily), **loan seasoning and characteristics** (newer loans might prepay less until some time has passed, higher LTV loans might have less opportunity to refinance), and **external factors** (housing prices, economy, etc.). The model often uses historical loan data to see prepayment behavior under various rate conditions. For example, one might fit a statistical model (like a logistic regression or survival model) where the probability of prepayment in a given period depends on the spread of the borrower’s note rate above current market mortgage rates, the age of the loan, and possibly seasonality. **Baseline CPR** (conditional prepayment rate) curves can be established for each portfolio under normal conditions.

**Interest Rate Sensitivity:** A crucial aspect is how CPR changes when interest rates change. Generally, if rates drop significantly below the loan’s rate, prepayments surge (as borrowers refinance). If rates rise above the loan’s rate, prepayments slow (borrowers stick with their low-rate loan). As mentioned, Basel suggests applying multipliers to CPR in shocked scenarios (e.g., 1.2× CPR when rates fall, 0.8× when rates rise) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=123,of%20each%20loan%20in%20the)), though internal models can be more granular. Many banks use an option-theoretic approach: treat the prepayment option like a callable bond’s option and use option models to derive an “option-adjusted spread”. However, for IRRBB, simpler empirical models are common: e.g., link CPR to the **“refinancing incentive”** = current loan rate – current market rate. A rule of thumb might be: if incentive > 1%, CPR increases to some higher level. More sophisticated models might mimic those used by mortgage-backed securities analysts (e.g., with burnout effects, seasonality, etc.). **Segment models** can differentiate products: fixed-rate mortgages might have one model, auto loans another, credit card balances (revolving credit) another.

**Prepayment Modeling Techniques:**  
- **Static Factor Approach:** Assume a base prepayment curve (maybe derived from recent data or vendor benchmarks) and then apply scenario adjustments. This is relatively easy to implement: e.g., base CPR = 8% per year; in a +200bp scenario, assume CPR = 6%; in a -200bp scenario, CPR = 12%. These numbers should be justified by historical refi waves or a model like Basel’s multipliers. The advantage is simplicity; the drawback is it might not capture nonlinear effects or interactions with other variables.  
- **Dynamic Simulation:** Use a discrete-time simulation where at each time step, each loan has a probability to prepay that depends on the current interest rate environment. One can simulate many paths or directly project using expected values. For instance, one could simulate that in a falling rate scenario, X% of loans prepay immediately (a refinancing surge), then CPR stabilizes. This is more involved but can capture timing (e.g., not all prepayments happen at once; maybe it takes a few months for borrowers to act).
- **Vintage-based models:** These track cohorts of loans by origination period. For each cohort, track how their balance declines historically and fit models. This can capture that newer originations often have lower initial CPR and then ramp up.

**Incorporating into IRRBB Measures:** For EVE, prepayment modeling affects the cash flow schedule (and hence present value). The model will shorten the effective duration of loans when prepayment is likely. Typically, an average life is computed from the CPR. For example, a 30-year mortgage with 8% CPR might have an average life of ~7 years instead of 30. In a scenario where rates drop and CPR goes to, say, 15%, the average life might shrink to ~5 years, thus the PV change is mitigated (because the bank gets principal back sooner to reinvest at lower rates – a negative convexity effect). The IRRBB model should capture that intuitively: rising rates -> lengthen asset duration (bad for bank holding a fixed asset), falling rates -> shorten asset duration (also can be bad because you lose high-yield assets faster). For NII, prepayments will reduce interest income if not replaced by equally yielding assets. Under constant balance sheet assumption, we assume prepaid amounts are reinvested in new loans at current rates, so immediate impact can be a slight loss (if reinvestment rate is lower in a downward scenario, or if in upward scenario prepayments slow, the bank keeps earning old lower rate longer, which also can hurt if market rates higher). These effects should be reflected in the NII simulation.

**Model Calibration and Validation:** Prepayment models are usually calibrated with historical **pool data** (e.g., how did CPR change in past rate cycles?). Backtesting is key: after a rate move, compare predicted vs actual prepayment. If a model overpredicted CPR in a rate drop, maybe borrowers faced frictions (like credit tightening) that model didn’t account for – adjust model. Also consider **portfolio changes**: if the bank’s loan portfolio changes (different customer profile or product features), the model should be revisited. Document all model drivers and assumptions; Basel expects banks to **document the factors influencing prepayment assumptions** (loan size, LTV, borrower type, geography, etc. are cited as important) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Product%20Dimensions%20influencing%20the%20exercise,stock%20indices%2C%20unemployment%20rates%2C%20GDP)), and to be able to explain why those factors matter. For example, high-LTV loans might prepay less because borrowers can’t easily refinance without enough equity.

### 6.3 Other Behavioral Elements  
While deposits and loans are the major items, a comprehensive IRRBB model should also address other behavioral optionalities:

- **Term Deposit Redemption:** If the bank has significant volumes of term deposits (or borrowings) that customers can redeem early, a model similar to loan prepayment is needed. Typically, one might assume a certain percentage of depositors will break their deposit if the opportunity cost (difference between current market rate and their deposit rate) exceeds a threshold. The model could be simpler (e.g., assume X% attrition for a 100bp rate increase) or based on observed behavior. In EVE, early redemption effectively shortens liability duration (costly for bank if rates rise and depositors leave early, forcing bank to refinance at higher rates). Basel suggests documenting whether term deposits have penalties that discourage early withdrawal and then modeling the ones without effective penalties with a redemption rate assumption ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=,or%20to%20other%20contractual%20features)).

- **Loan Commitments / Credit Lines:** Unused credit lines (HELOCs, credit card lines) and loan commitments can be drawn by customers. For IRRBB, the main risk is if a commitment is at a fixed rate (then it’s like a written option to the customer). Banks should model the **utilization** of credit lines under scenarios – for instance, if interest rates fall, more borrowers may take fixed-rate loans that were committed; if rates rise, maybe fewer do. For floating-rate commitments, IRRBB is less about option risk and more about volume uncertainty (which is more a liquidity/credit concern). Still, including an assumption for utilization is part of a rigorous IRRBB model to project balances.

- **Behavioral Offset and Portfolio Changes:** One behavioral aspect often considered is how the **bank itself** might respond (though this veers into management action rather than customer behavior). For example, some IRRBB frameworks allow modeling that the bank would adjust transfer pricing or move rates in anticipation of customer moves. Generally, for regulatory IRRBB, we *do not* assume management actions to reduce IRRBB (except normal pricing strategies reflected in betas) – the idea is to see the exposure if no hedging actions are taken post-shock. However, internal behavioral models could include assumptions like, “if we see X outflow, we will raise deposit rates by Y to stem it,” which effectively is a feedback loop to reduce outflow. Such nuances should be clearly separated (usually not included in the pure risk measure, but can be part of capital planning).

Overall, behavioral modeling is about making the **balance sheet model realistic**. Without it, IRRBB measures can be grossly mis-estimated (e.g., treating all deposits as overnight can overstate risk, treating them as fully fixed can understate risk – the truth is in between). The methodologies rely on a combination of historical data analysis, economic reasoning, and sometimes constraints or guidelines from regulators. All behavioral models should be **well documented** with their methodology, data inputs, any expert judgment applied, and limitations. They should also be subject to **periodic validation**, as discussed next.

## 7. Interest Rate Shock and Stress Testing Scenarios  
Once the model (EVE and NII) is in place with all data and assumptions, we need to define the **interest rate scenarios** to run through the model. This includes both the regulatory-prescribed shock scenarios and internal stress scenarios:

**Regulatory Shock Scenarios:** Basel and other regulators have defined specific instantaneous shock scenarios that banks must apply. As noted, there are **six standard scenarios for EVE** and **two for NII** ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Annex%202%20The%20standardised%20interest,across%20jurisdictions%2C%20the%20six%20shock)). These scenarios are usually: 

- *Parallel Up:* An upward parallel shift of the entire yield curve (all maturities) by a specified number of basis points (bps).  
- *Parallel Down:* A downward parallel shift of the yield curve by the same magnitude (with constraints like not going below zero or some floor if negative rates are an issue).  
- *Steepener:* A scenario where short-term interest rates decrease and long-term rates increase, making the yield curve steeper. For example, shock might be -100bps on the short end, +100bps on the long end (calibrated specifically per currency).  
- *Flattener:* The opposite of steepener: short-term rates rise, long-term rates fall, flattening or inverting the curve.  
- *Short-rate up:* An increase concentrated in short maturities (while long end moves little). Basel defines this as an upward shock that diminishes toward zero at the long end ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=,short%20rates%20shock%20down)).  
- *Short-rate down:* A decrease in short-term rates (diminishing to no change at long end).

Under Basel’s approach, these shocks are calibrated to historical 1st and 99th percentile moves, with different magnitudes for each currency (for example, a 200bp parallel shock for USD, 250bp for GBP, 100bp for JPY, etc., reflecting different rate volatility) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Table%201,150%20100%20300%20150%20300)). Banks should apply each scenario to the entire relevant yield curve for the currency and re-compute ∆EVE. For NII, typically only the Parallel Up and Parallel Down scenarios are required (on a 12-month horizon) since earnings measures focus on general rate rises/falls ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Banks%20should%20apply%20six%20prescribed,across%20jurisdictions%2C%20the%20six%20shock)). The shock is assumed to occur instantaneously at the start of the period and then rates remain at the shocked levels (or move in parallel from that baseline) over the horizon for NII calculation.

It’s important that the model also consider **any constraints** like rate floors. Basel’s standard shocks assume no negative rates beyond certain floors (e.g., if a downward shock would imply -2%, it might floor at -0.5% depending on jurisdiction) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=risks%20for%20EVE%20and%20two,2000%20to%202015%20for%20various)). Banks should implement scenario floors consistent with guidance or their internal risk view.

**Internal Stress Scenarios:** Beyond the regulatory set, banks are expected to run **more severe or tailored scenarios** as part of risk management ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=,market%20conditions%20%E2%80%93%20including%20the)). These include:  
- **Historical Scenarios:** Replay notable interest rate events (e.g., the rapid rate rise in 2022-2023, the 2008 financial crisis rate cuts, the 1970s high inflation era, etc.). Historical scenarios give insight into how the current portfolio would fare if past yield curve moves repeat. They often involve non-parallel moves and multi-step changes (not just instantaneous).  
- **Hypothetical Stresses:** Construct worse-case scenarios beyond normal shocks. For example, assume a **+400bps shock** (if Basel is +200bps) to test extreme vulnerability, or a scenario with a sharp inversion (e.g., short rates up +300bps, long rates down -100bps) to reflect a policy error scenario. Or assume rates stay low for an extended period vs. jump to high and back – any pattern that could be risky. These stresses are usually *more severe than the standardized shocks* to test the bank’s limits ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=,market%20conditions%20%E2%80%93%20including%20the)). They might also combine interest rate moves with changes in other variables if doing integrated stress tests, though for IRRBB specifically, it’s about rates and their direct effects.  
- **Basis Risk Scenarios:** These are scenarios where different benchmark rates move differently. For example, a widening of the gap between LIBOR and Treasury yields, or between local currency rates and USD rates. If a bank has significant basis exposure (like funding tied to one index and assets to another), it should shock those bases specifically (e.g., LIBOR up 100bps while Fed Funds up 50bps).  
- **Optionality-specific Scenarios:** Test scenarios that specifically stress optionality. For instance, a scenario where rates drop dramatically could lead to an unprecedented wave of prepayments – beyond historical experience. Or a scenario where the yield curve swings up and then down might trigger multiple option exercises. Banks sometimes do *path-dependent* stress (though not required by Basel) to see how dynamic management might have to react.

**Forward-Looking/Complex Scenarios:** While the standardized shocks are instantaneous, internal scenarios can be **forward-looking** – e.g., simulate a gradual increase of +300bps over 12 months (ramp scenario) and see NII effects quarter by quarter, or a shock followed by mean reversion. These help in strategy (e.g., how much earnings drop before the bank reprices loans). They are also useful for ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process) to assess if the bank holds enough capital for worst case IRRBB losses over the plan horizon ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=37,looking)) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=planning%20decisions,should%20be%20commensurate%20with%20its)).

**Stress Testing Framework:** Regulators expect banks to have a formal **stress testing framework for IRRBB** integrated with overall risk management ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=37,looking)) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=planning%20decisions,should%20be%20commensurate%20with%20its)). This means scenario design should involve business experts (treasury, economists) and consider the business context. For example, in a low-rate environment, include the possibility of negative rates or a sudden rebound; in a high-rate environment, consider persistent high rates. The framework should **clearly document each scenario’s rationale** and assumptions (for instance, “Steepener scenario assumes central bank cuts rates due to recession while long-term inflation expectations rise, thus yield curve steepens. Under this scenario, deposit outflows might also occur as customers seek yield.”). The impact on EVE, NII, and even secondary effects (like liquidity or credit interactions) should be assessed. 

**Policy and Limits:** The results of shock and stress scenarios feed into setting or revising **IRRBB limits**. A bank might set a policy limit like “∆EVE under regulatory shocks not to exceed X% of capital” or “∆NII under 100bp parallel shock not to exceed Y% of next year’s earnings”. If stress tests show outcomes close to or beyond these limits, management must take action (hedge, restructure, etc.). Principle 4 of Basel emphasizes using stress results when establishing risk appetite and limits ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=36,making)) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=planning%20decisions,should%20be%20commensurate%20with%20its)).

**Reverse Stress Testing:** In IRRBB context, reverse stress testing can be done to ask “what interest rate scenario would cause us to hit a particular loss threshold (e.g., 20% capital erosion)?” This can help identify combinations of moves that are particularly dangerous (maybe a steepener of a certain magnitude). Some banks include this for completeness, although it’s not mandated.

**Frequency:** IRRBB shock scenarios (standard ones) are often run at least quarterly for reporting. Internal stress scenarios might be run quarterly or semi-annually, and ad-hoc if market conditions rapidly change. During volatile periods, management might monitor NII sensitivity monthly.

In implementing scenarios, ensure that the **interest rate term structure is properly shocked**: e.g., for a steepener, define which point of the curve pivots. Basel provides formulas for their standard scenarios (shocks are not purely linear but tailored by maturity) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=,EUR%20GBP%20HKD%20IDR%20INR)) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Given%20Table%201%2C%20the%20instantaneous,shock%20scenarios%20should%20be%20applied)). Many banks will simply apply the regulatory-prescribed shifts. Internal scenarios can be input as shock vectors (a set of deltas for various maturities).

Finally, **document all scenario analyses** and results. Regulators will want to see not just the numbers, but that the bank considered *why* certain scenarios are important and *how* the bank would respond. They also expect banks to incorporate scenario results into capital planning – for example, if a severe shock could wipe out a chunk of capital, is there a capital buffer allocated for that? In ICAAP, banks often allocate internal capital for IRRBB equal to the worst ∆EVE or some multiple of it, or ensure that ∆NII impact can be absorbed by earnings without breaching solvency.

## 8. Model Calibration, Testing, and Validation Steps  
Developing the model is only half the battle; it must be **calibrated and validated** to ensure it reliably predicts risk. A strong model validation framework for IRRBB covers data verification, conceptual soundness, outcome analysis (backtesting), and governance oversight ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=59,process%20verification%20and%20benchmarking%3B%20and)). Key steps include:

**Calibration of Behavioral Parameters:** Calibrating the IRRBB model means tuning the assumptions and parameters so that the model’s outputs align with empirical evidence. For example:  
- **Prepayment Model Calibration:** Use historical data on loan prepayments to calibrate the relationship between interest rates and CPR. If using a statistical model, estimate its parameters (e.g., coefficient linking rate incentive to prepayment speed). If using a simpler rule (like Basel multipliers), verify that those multipliers would have roughly matched past refinancing waves. One might calibrate separate CPR assumptions for different portfolios (e.g., prime mortgages vs subprime vs auto loans) based on their observed behavior.  
- **Deposit Model Calibration:** Analyze historical deposit balances and pricing. For decay rates, one method is to take a cohort of accounts and see what fraction remains after 1 year, 2 years, etc., to derive an average life. For betas, perform regression of product rates on market rates for different periods. Calibration should cover normal times and stress times if possible (for instance, did betas change when rates were near zero?). Often, calibration is iterative: initial assumptions are set, then as new data comes in (especially after a rate cycle turn), the assumptions are adjusted to better fit reality. **Benchmarking** against industry data can help (e.g., if your bank’s behavior is similar to peers, peer data can supplement when internal data is limited), but be cautious to not rely purely on industry averages over your own data ([
	Considerations for Interest Rate Risk Modeling in an Elevated Rate Environment
](https://www.communitybankingconnections.org/Articles/2024/R1/interest-rate-risk-modeling#:~:text=match%20at%20L325%20competition%2C%20and,with%20effective%20risk%20management%20practices)).

**Backtesting and Outcomes Analysis:** Once the model is calibrated, banks perform backtesting to validate its predictive power. Backtesting IRRBB can be challenging because it’s about hypothetical rate moves, but you can use actual historical periods as quasi-scenarios:
- For EVE: If interest rates moved from point A to B over some period, compare the model’s predicted ∆EVE for that move (perhaps by treating it like a scenario) to the actual change in the economic value of the portfolio over that period. However, since actual portfolio also changes with new business, isolate the effect by looking at a static portfolio. Another approach is comparing the model’s EVE number to simpler calculations (like gap reports or duration-based approximations) to see if they are in the same ballpark.
- For NII: This is more straightforward to backtest. Compare the model-projected NII for the last, say, 12 months (using the model a year ago with whatever rate scenario that actually occurred) to the actual realized NII. Of course, differences will arise from volume changes or deviations in rate paths, but one can adjust for those and see if the model’s elasticity to rates was accurate. If the bank’s internal stress test last year predicted that a +100bp rate increase would raise NII by $X, and then rates did rise about that much and NII rose by a significantly different amount, investigate why – maybe deposit betas were higher than assumed or loan yields lagged. This feedback is used to recalibrate or at least to understand model limitations.

Basel guidance explicitly calls for **outcomes analysis including backtesting of key parameters like deposit stability and prepayments** ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20outcomes%20analysis%2C%20including%20backtesting,with%20the%20modelling%20technique%20employed)). For example, if the model assumed a certain deposit decay, check actual decay; if assumed CPR of 8%, check realized CPR. Banks should maintain statistical measures of error for these assumptions and ensure they are within reasonable bounds.

**Sensitivity Analysis and Assumption Stressing:** A good validation practice is to stress-test the model’s assumptions themselves. This means varying one assumption at a time to see how sensitive results are. For instance, run the EVE calculation with deposit average life 2 years shorter than base assumption, or with a prepayment rate +50% higher, and observe how ∆EVE or ∆NII changes. This identifies which assumptions the IRRBB results are most sensitive to. Management should pay special attention to those. In some cases, tolerance ranges can be set: e.g., “if changing an assumption by 10% changes ∆EVE by more than 1% of capital, that assumption is critical and must be estimated with extra care.” The U.S. Fed has noted that banks should stress test IRR assumptions and consider the results relative to limits ([
	Considerations for Interest Rate Risk Modeling in an Elevated Rate Environment
](https://www.communitybankingconnections.org/Articles/2024/R1/interest-rate-risk-modeling#:~:text=Appropriately%20justified%20bank,include%20assumptions%20regarding%20asset%20prepayment)). This kind of sensitivity check might reveal, for example, that a slight change in deposit beta drastically alters NII outcomes – indicating the need for robust processes around setting that beta.

**Benchmarking and Comparison:** Compare the model outputs to **standardized or alternative measures**. Basel suggests that banks compare their internal model ∆EVE with the standardized framework results as a credibility check ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=could%20impact%20the%20banks%E2%80%99%20economic,Banks%20should%20periodically)). If the internal model shows much lower risk than the standardized approach, one should explain which assumptions drive that and ensure they’re justified. Conversely, if internal shows much higher, perhaps the bank is conservative or the standard approach doesn’t capture something unique in the bank’s portfolio. Additionally, within the internal model, using different methodologies and comparing can help (for example, run a simple duration-gap approximation of EVE sensitivity and compare to the full model output). While differences will occur, orders of magnitude should align.

**Independent Model Validation:** Per regulatory expectations, IRRBB models should undergo independent validation by a unit not involved in model development ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Principle%206%3A%20Measurement%20systems%20and,independent%20of%20the%20development%20process)). This validation group will review the model’s theoretical foundations, check the coding/implementation, verify data inputs, and replicate results on sample portfolios. They will also review the **conceptual soundness** – e.g., are the behavioral models used widely accepted and do they make sense for the bank’s products? Are there any known weaknesses? This process should result in a validation report highlighting any deficiencies and recommending improvements. Common validation tests include:
- Re-calculating EVE for select transactions manually (to ensure the model discounts correctly).
- Verifying that scenario shocks are applied correctly (no mistakes like a shock being inverted or not applied to certain segments).
- Checking boundary conditions (e.g., if all rates are zero, does model behave logically? If all positions are perfectly matched, does ∆EVE ~ 0?).
- **Process verification:** ensuring data feeds, governance, and usage of model outputs are as documented.

**Validation of Assumptions:** The validation team will specifically look at the key assumptions and ask: Are they well supported? For example, if the bank assumes a 5-year average life for core deposits, is there analysis of historical data to back this up? They might perform their own analysis or request additional data. If vendor models or external benchmarks are used (say the bank uses a vendor’s prepayment model), the validator will ensure the bank has validated the vendor model (through outcomes, or comparing to actual portfolio behavior). 

**Ongoing Performance Monitoring:** Post initial validation, the model should be subject to ongoing monitoring. Each quarter (or risk cycle), the risk team should produce metrics on model performance: e.g., track actual vs predicted NII, track changes in key assumptions (did core deposit % change and why?), check if any override or manual adjustment was needed. **Version control** is important: if any model parameters are changed (recalibrated), it should be logged and ideally validated if material. The model validation function might re-validate the model annually or when significant changes occur.

**Documentation of Validation:** All validation activities and results should be documented. Basel suggests an effective validation framework will include evidence of conceptual soundness review, benchmarking, and backtesting results ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=59,process%20verification%20and%20benchmarking%3B%20and)). Any weaknesses found should lead to either compensating controls or model improvements. For example, if validation finds that the model doesn’t handle negative interest rates (perhaps it wasn’t originally designed for that, and now rates are near zero), a plan should be in place to enhance the model.

**Governance Use of Validation:** The findings from model calibration and validation should be reported to the bank’s **Model Risk Committee or ALCO**. If the model is found to be inadequate in some aspect, senior management must decide whether to constrain its use (e.g., add extra capital buffer, or not use it for limit setting until fixed) or accept the risk temporarily while fixing it. Supervisors will also review validation reports and procedures as part of their assessment of the bank’s IRRBB management ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Principle%206%3A%20Measurement%20systems%20and,independent%20of%20the%20development%20process)).

In short, calibration and validation ensure the IRRBB model is not a “black box” but a well-understood tool with known accuracy. Given the complexity (multiple assumptions and approaches), it’s expected that **validation is an ongoing process**, not a one-time event. Models should evolve with the portfolio and environment, and validation provides the feedback loop for continuous improvement.

## 9. Governance and Model Documentation  
Strong governance and comprehensive documentation are the backbone of an effective IRRBB framework. Regulators require that IRRBB measurement systems be supported by governance processes akin to those for other key risk models (like credit or market risk), including oversight, validation, and regular review ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Principle%206%3A%20Measurement%20systems%20and,independent%20of%20the%20development%20process)).

**Policy and Governance Framework:** The bank should have an **IRRBB policy** or **ALM policy** that delineates how IRRBB is managed. This policy (approved by the Board or its risk committee) should cover the risk appetite (limits on ∆EVE, ∆NII), roles and responsibilities (e.g. ALCO oversees IRRBB, Treasury manages day-to-day IRRBB, Risk Management validates models, etc.), and the approach to modeling and assumptions. It should also reference compliance with applicable regulations (Basel guidelines, national supervisor rules). A **governance structure** is typically in place: ALCO or a dedicated risk committee reviews IRRBB reports regularly ([](http://ma.moodys.com/rs/961-KCJ-308/images/interest-rate-risk-in-the-banking-book-meeting-the-practical-challenges.pdf#:~:text=PRINCIPLE%202%3A%20GOVERNANCE%20Principle%202,importance%20of%20anticipation%20of%20specific)); a model risk management committee oversees the model’s validation status. Principle 2 of the Basel IRRBB guidelines emphasizes that the Board is ultimately responsible for IRRBB oversight, including ensuring a robust framework is in place ([](http://ma.moodys.com/rs/961-KCJ-308/images/interest-rate-risk-in-the-banking-book-meeting-the-practical-challenges.pdf#:~:text=PRINCIPLE%202%3A%20GOVERNANCE%20Principle%202,importance%20of%20anticipation%20of%20specific)).

**Model Development and Approval:** When developing the IRRBB model, a clear process should exist from development to deployment. The model (and any subsequent significant changes) should be reviewed and approved by a committee (often Model Risk Committee). Before approval, an **independent validation** (as described above) must occur ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=61,usage%20should%20be%20presented%20to)). Governance should ensure there is **separation between model developers and validators** to avoid conflicts ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=Principle%206%3A%20Measurement%20systems%20and,independent%20of%20the%20development%20process)). Model documentation (see below) is prepared as part of this approval. The governing body or its delegate (e.g., Chief Risk Officer, ALCO) formally signs off on the model for use in risk management and regulatory reporting.

**Ongoing Oversight and Reporting:** Regular IRRBB reports should be provided to management and the Board. Basel Principle 7 states that IRRBB exposures and hedging strategies outcomes should be reported to the governing body regularly ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=)) ([](http://ma.moodys.com/rs/961-KCJ-308/images/interest-rate-risk-in-the-banking-book-meeting-the-practical-challenges.pdf#:~:text=PRINCIPLE%203%3A%20RISK%20APPETITE%20%E2%80%9CDASHBOARD%E2%80%9D,September%202016)). These reports include the current ∆EVE and ∆NII against limits, breakdown by currency, key assumption sensitivities, and any policy breaches or exceptions. They may also include summaries of stress test results, and actions taken. If limits are breached or model weaknesses identified, governance should ensure timely remediation. 

**Limits and Escalation:** The governance framework should include **trigger levels** and escalation processes. For example, if ∆EVE approaches a certain threshold, ALCO might require hedging or reduction in risk. If a model assumption is found to be no longer valid (say customer behavior changed drastically), there should be a process to escalate this finding and approve interim measures (like temporarily adjusting the assumption or adding a capital buffer) until a model update is done. Governance ensures IRRBB remains within the risk appetite and that there is accountability for managing it.

**Documentation Requirements:** Comprehensive documentation is critical both for internal understanding and for regulatory scrutiny. The IRRBB model documentation should include:
- **Methodology Documentation:** Detailed description of the model design for EVE and NII, including mathematical formulas, calculation steps, and reasoning. For example, how exactly ∆EVE is computed, how cash flows are generated, how discounting is done. Any simplifications or approximations should be noted.
- **Assumption Documentation:** A catalog of all key assumptions (behavioral and others) used in the model, with rationale and supporting analysis for each ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=50,and%20more%20frequently%20during%20rapidly)). This might reference studies or data (e.g., a memo on core deposit analysis, a chart of historical prepayment rates). It should also document how assumptions might be adjusted under scenarios (like the rules for scenario-dependent prepayment speeds).
- **Data Documentation:** Explanation of data sources, definitions of fields, data quality controls, and any data transformations or mappings in the model. Essentially, enough detail that one could trace an input (like “commercial loans – total balance”) from the general ledger or source system through any mappings into the IRRBB model input format ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=54,in%20the%20bank%E2%80%99s%20risk%20measurement)).
- **System/Process Documentation:** Description of the IT system or tool used for IRRBB calculations. This might include system architecture, how scenarios are input, how results are produced, and interfaces with other systems. If a vendor software is used, documentation of the software version and any configuration/customization done should be kept.
- **Validation Documentation:** All validation reports, model review minutes, and testing results should be archived. Often, regulators will ask for evidence of validation. The model documentation pack should thus include the latest validation report or a summary of validation findings and resolutions ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=59,process%20verification%20and%20benchmarking%3B%20and)).
- **Change Log:** Keep a history of model changes (assumption updates, methodology tweaks) with dates, description, and approvals. This is important for audit trail and also to explain any shifts in measured risk not due to actual risk change but due to model change.

When third-party components are used (like a prepayment model from a vendor or a yield curve data feed), ensure documentation covers these as well. Basel guidance notes that if banks use vendor models or inputs, they must document how those are integrated and ensure they understand them ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=vendor,place%20to%20determine%20if%20those)) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=64,management%20process%20as%20part%20of)). For example, if using QRM or BancWare (common ALM systems), the bank’s documentation should still explain the configuration and any overrides, not just say “we use vendor default”.

**Model Governance Policies:** Many banks have a **Model Risk Management Policy** (aligned with regulatory guidance like Fed SR 11-7 in the U.S.). IRRBB models fall under this and thus require periodic review. Typically, IRRBB models would be classified by importance (often high, because of impact on capital and earnings), so they might require annual validation and Board notification. Internal Audit should periodically review the IRRBB model and governance process as part of model risk audit, ensuring compliance with policy ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=inputs%20are%20reasonable%20for%20its,the%20model%20risk%20management%20process)). 

**Audit and Regulatory Review:** Internal Audit provides independent assurance that the IRRBB framework is functioning as intended (they might audit the data flow, the limit governance, the reporting integrity, etc., not necessarily redo calculations). Regulators during examinations will look at the governance minutes (did ALCO discuss IRRBB? Are decisions documented?), the model documentation (to see if it meets their standards), and may even challenge assumptions or require adjustments if they find them lacking. Having strong governance and documentation puts the bank in a good position to justify its IRRBB approach. 

In essence, good governance ensures that the IRRBB model is not static – it is reviewed, challenged, and improved over time, and its output is meaningfully used in decision making. All of this should be transparent via documentation. Banks should cultivate a culture where IRRBB metrics are taken seriously by management (not just for regulatory compliance but as part of strategic planning, such as evaluating interest rate hedging or product pricing strategies). That linkage between the model and decision-making is often examined by supervisors to ensure IRRBB is truly embedded in the bank’s risk management.

## 10. Implementation Best Practices and Common Pitfalls  
Successfully implementing an IRRBB model in a commercial bank involves not just technical modeling but also process and organizational considerations. Below are some best practices to follow and pitfalls to avoid:

**Best Practices:**
- **Ensure Cross-Functional Collaboration:** IRRBB modeling should involve Treasury/ALM, Risk Management, Finance, and Business units. Treasury provides insight on balance sheet strategy and likely management actions; Risk offers independent oversight and technical modeling skill; Finance ensures alignment with financial plans. A collaborative approach in setting assumptions (e.g., deposit pricing strategy) yields more credible models and buy-in from stakeholders.
- **Alignment with Business Strategy:** Use the IRRBB model as a tool for decision-making, not just regulatory compliance. For instance, when planning new product offerings or loan/deposit mix changes, project the IRRBB impact. Integrate IRRBB consideration into product pricing (through Funds Transfer Pricing systems) so that business lines are incentivized to manage interest rate risk. This makes the model’s outputs directly relevant, improving its accuracy over time (since people care to keep it accurate if it affects them).
- **Regular Review and Update Cycle:** As a living model, schedule periodic reviews of assumptions (at least annually, or more often if big market changes occur) ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=51,smaller%20reductions%20in%20interest%20rates)). Use the latest data to refresh calibrations. Document any changes thoroughly and get approvals. Likewise, review scenario definitions periodically – ensure scenarios remain relevant (for example, if negative rates become a real possibility, incorporate that in scenarios, if not already).
- **Perform “What-If” Analyses Frequently:** In addition to set scenarios, run ad-hoc analyses for emerging risks. For example, if yield curve is expected to invert, what is the impact? If a sudden rate spike happens next quarter, are we within limits? This proactivity helps avoid surprises and allows time to execute hedges or balance sheet moves. It also tests the model in more situations, building confidence or revealing gaps.
- **Data Quality Management:** Invest in data infrastructure so that IRRBB data is timely and accurate. Automate extraction from source systems and reconciliation processes. Maintain a data dictionary for IRRBB inputs. Many issues in IRRBB models stem from inconsistent or erroneous data (e.g., a batch of loans missing reset dates leading to misclassification in time buckets). Strong controls (with IT and data governance teams involved) are a best practice to minimize these errors ([Interest rate risk in the banking book](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d368.pdf#:~:text=documentation%20of%20the%20major%20data,or%20assigned%20to)).
- **Transparency and Traceability:** Make model outputs explainable to senior management. For each scenario result, provide attribution if possible – e.g., “The 5% drop in EVE mainly comes from mortgages (due to their long duration) which contribute -$X, partially offset by deposits +$Y.” This kind of breakdown helps management trust the model and also points to risk concentrations (maybe hedge mortgages specifically). If the model is a black box, it will be less useful. Also, maintain traceability from input assumptions to output – if someone questions an output, being able to trace back and adjust an input to see the effect is valuable.
- **Independent Review and Challenge:** Aside from formal validation, encourage a culture of challenge. For example, ALCO members should feel free to question “Why do we assume a 0.5 beta on deposits? Can we justify that?” and the team should have answers or take an action to investigate. This avoids groupthink and complacency. Comparing with peer practices (if information is available via industry forums or regulator feedback) can also highlight if your assumptions are outliers.

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- **Over-Reliance on Default or Generic Assumptions:** Using industry averages or vendor default settings without tailoring to your bank’s reality is dangerous. Regulators have warned that generic assumptions not reflecting bank-specific behavior are not sound practice ([
	Considerations for Interest Rate Risk Modeling in an Elevated Rate Environment
](https://www.communitybankingconnections.org/Articles/2024/R1/interest-rate-risk-modeling#:~:text=match%20at%20L325%20competition%2C%20and,with%20effective%20risk%20management%20practices)). For example, blindly assuming a 5-year deposit duration because “that’s what others do” could misrepresent your risk. Always test if such an assumption holds for your data.
- **Lack of Granularity:** Aggregating too much can mask risks. For instance, modeling all deposits as one category might hide that corporate clients behave very differently from retail. Best practice is to segment into relatively homogeneous groups. Yes, more granularity means more complexity and data needs, but too little granularity is a pitfall leading to averaging out important nuances (like one segment’s risk offsetting another’s in model, while in reality they’d behave differently under stress).
- **Ignoring Basis and Optionality Risks:** Some banks focus only on parallel shocks and basic gap analysis, missing other dimensions. **Basis risk** (different reference rates) is often overlooked – e.g., mortgage loans tied to long-term rates funded by deposits tied to short-term rates: if those rates move differently, EVE/NII can suffer even if your gap looks balanced. Likewise, **option risk** (caps, floors, early withdrawals) if not modeled, can cause actual outcomes to deviate significantly from model expectations. It’s a pitfall to assume these are “minor” – always assess materiality and include them if significant.
- **Static Assumption in Dynamic World:** Not updating assumptions as the world changes. A prime example is deposit behavior in a prolonged low-rate environment vs a rapid rising-rate environment. If a bank assumed a low beta because for years rates were near zero (so they never had to pay up), and then rates jump, they might find betas are much higher now as customers demand more. If the model isn’t updated, NII projections will be overly optimistic. Similarly, competitive environment shifts (fintechs offering high-yield savings) could erode core deposits – a model must be revisited to incorporate such shifts. Pitfall is to set and forget assumptions.
- **Model Complexity without Commensurate Validation:** Sometimes models become very complex (e.g., advanced stochastic modeling of customer behaviors). Complexity itself is not bad, but only if there’s enough data to support it and if the organization can validate and understand it. A pitfall is having a fancy model that management doesn’t fully grasp or trust. It might then be ignored in decisions, defeating its purpose. It’s better to have a slightly simpler model that is well understood and continuously improved, than an ultra-complex one that’s essentially a black box.
- **Poor Documentation and Key-Person Risk:** If only one or two experts know how the model works and nothing is well documented, the bank is at risk if they leave or if something goes wrong. Regulators will also view this negatively. Good documentation and training of a team (rather than a single model owner) avoids this. A pitfall to avoid is the “model run by a guru” scenario.
- **Not Integrating IRRBB into Enterprise Risk Management:** Treating IRRBB as a silo or pure compliance exercise can be problematic. For instance, if the bank’s strategic plan is to extend loan durations or invest in longer bonds, and the IRRBB team is not consulted, the bank could inadvertently breach risk limits or take on too much IRRBB. Integration means IRRBB metrics are considered in strategy (asset allocation, funding strategy, pricing). A disconnect is a governance pitfall.

- **Inadequate Systems and Resources:** Some banks underestimate the infrastructure needed. Trying to run a complex IRRBB model on a spreadsheet with manual processes is error-prone. Investing in a robust ALM system and skilled personnel yields dividends. A common pitfall is budget constraints leading to patchwork solutions that may suffice in normal times but falter during volatile periods when fast and accurate analysis is needed.

**Regulatory Compliance vs. Economic Reality:** One must balance meeting the letter of regulatory requirements with capturing the economic reality of the bank’s risk. The standardized scenarios and measures are a baseline; banks should not optimize the model just to pass the regulatory tests (e.g., gaming the outlier test by tweaking assumptions) at the expense of not understanding their real risk. Regulators can usually spot if assumptions seem tailored just to reduce reported risk without basis. Always be ready to defend assumptions with evidence.

Finally, document and learn from **mistakes or misses**. If the bank ever experiences an unexpected loss or a big deviation between forecasted and actual NII due to interest rates, treat it as a model risk incident. Investigate what assumption or part of the model was wrong, fix it, and record the learning. Over time, this process greatly enhances the model’s accuracy and credibility.

By following these best practices and avoiding the pitfalls, a bank will have an IRRBB model and framework that not only complies with regulatory requirements but also genuinely supports the bank’s financial stability and strategic decision-making. An effective IRRBB model is one that both satisfies examiners and is valued by the bank’s management as a insightful tool for navigating interest rate cycles.
