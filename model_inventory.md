## Additional Notes

- **Model Granularity**: In practice, many of these model categories are implemented as multiple sub-models tailored to specific geographies, customer segments, product types, or regulatory jurisdictions.
- **Model Integration**: Many of these models feed into others (e.g., PD/LGD/EAD models feed into IFRS 9 provisioning and stress testing), creating complex model ecosystems.
- **Model Governance**: All models are subject to comprehensive model risk management frameworks including documentation, validation, performance monitoring, and periodic review.
- **Emerging Areas**: New model categories continue to emerge in areas like quantum computing for portfolio optimization, artificial intelligence for advanced anomaly detection, and alternative data integration across risk domains.
- **Regulatory Context**: Model implementation details often vary based on regulatory regime (Basel, Fed/OCC, PRA, ECB) and bank size classification.
