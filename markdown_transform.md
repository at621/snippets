Please convert this PDF to a clean, well-structured Markdown document following these specific guidelines:

**Text Conversion:**
- Preserve the logical hierarchy using Markdown headings (#, ##, ###, etc.)
- Keep all bullet points, numbered lists, bold/italic formatting, and block quotes
- Maintain the original section order throughout

**Table Handling:**
- Tables with 5 columns or fewer OR 10 rows or fewer: Convert to Markdown tables
- Larger tables: Render as plain text with columns aligned using at least two spaces

**Formulas/Equations:**
- Convert every equation to an executable Python code block
- Use triple backticks with `python` language tag

**Images/Figures:**
- Replace each figure with: `![Figure n](image_n.ext)`
- Include the original caption
- Add a detailed alt-text description (3-5 complete sentences) explaining:
  - Main visual elements
  - Relationships shown
  - Relevant data displayed
  - Make it informative enough to understand without seeing the image

**Content Cleaning:**
- Remove recurring headers, footers, page numbers, date stamps, and document codes
- Delete duplicate document titles across pages
- Keep ALL actual content: headings, paragraphs, footnotes, and emphasis

**Formatting:**
- Leave one blank line between major sections
- Indent nested lists consistently
- Provide a single Markdown document ready to save as a .md file
