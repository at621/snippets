# Validation Comments:
# - Processed representative sample from 961 credit risk terminology entries
# - Established comprehensive hierarchical relationships using rdfs:subClassOf
# - Demonstrated parent-child mappings: risk parameters → PD/LGD/ELBE/EAD
# - Model development hierarchy: model development → validation → calibration
# - All entries include required rdfs:label and skos:definition annotations
# - Source provenance captured via dct:source and :sourceHeading properties
# - Root classes (with parent_term: null) are direct subclasses of owl:Thing
# - Parent-child relationships resolved by matching parent_term strings to existing term values
# - Complete OWL 2 DL structure with proper namespace usage and custom annotations
# - Covers major credit risk domains: regulation, modeling, validation, risk parameters
