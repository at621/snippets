    "## Introduction to the Book Generation Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter cell contains Python code designed to automatically generate a book in LaTeX format.  It leverages several key technologies to streamline the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **OpenAI's language models (like GPT-4o):** To generate the actual content of each book section based on a defined outline and relevant background information.\n",
    "*   **Pandas:** To efficiently manage and load background data, which is expected to be pre-processed and saved in a pickle file. This background data contains text and pre-calculated embeddings for similarity searches.\n",
    "*   **Pickle:** To load the background data quickly from a `.pkl` file, preserving the data structure and embeddings.\n",
    "*   **LaTeX:** To format the generated book content into a professional, high-quality PDF document.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's a high-level overview of what the code does:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Loads Book Outline:** Reads a JSON file (`book_outline.json`) that defines the structure of your book (sections, titles, goals, and required background for each section).\n",
    "2.  **Loads Background Data:** Loads a pre-processed Pandas DataFrame from a pickle file (`regulations_with_embeddings.pkl`). This DataFrame should contain background text and their corresponding embeddings.\n",
    "3.  **Iterates Through Book Sections:**  Loops through each section defined in the book outline.\n",
    "4.  **Finds Relevant Background Text:** For each section, it uses cosine similarity to find the most relevant background text from the loaded DataFrame based on the \"required background\" description in the outline.\n",
    "5.  **Generates Section Content with OpenAI:**  Uses OpenAI's API to generate the text content for each section, providing the section title, goal, and the most similar background text as context to the language model.\n",
    "6.  **Formats Content in LaTeX:**  Structures the generated text into LaTeX sections, including proper LaTeX preamble and postamble for a complete document.  It also includes basic escaping of LaTeX special characters in titles and preamble.\n",
    "7.  **Saves LaTeX File:**  Saves the complete LaTeX code to a `.tex` file (`generated_book.tex`).\n",
    "8.  **Compiles LaTeX to PDF (Optional):**  Attempts to automatically compile the generated `.tex` file into a PDF document using `pdflatex`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code provides a framework for automated book generation, and you can customize the outline, background data, prompts, and LaTeX formatting to create your own unique book.  Run the cell to start the book generation process!"
