# **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Conversion of PDF Documents to Pandas Dataframes for Q&A Systems**

---

## **Purpose:**  
To systematically and accurately transform content from PDF documents into a structured format suitable for Q&A systems using Pandas dataframes.

---

## **Scope:**  
This SOP is applicable to all teams and individuals involved in the process of feeding PDF content into Q&A systems.

---

## **Procedure:**

1. **Preparation of the PDF Text Document**  
   - Ensure that the PDF is in a text-readable format. Use Adobe Reader to convert pdf documents into text.

2. **Marking Sections for Exclusion**
   - Do not delete any sections from the original PDF.
   - To exclude specific paragraphs from being processed, flag the start with '&&' and conclude with '^^'.

3. **Heading Analysis and Structuring**
   - Thoroughly review the document.
   - Identify distinct heading levels present in the document.
   - Assign respective numbers of '#' to each heading level based on its hierarchy.

4. **Paragraph Formatting**
   - Confirm that paragraphs are concise, with no paragraph exceeding a length of 8 lines.
   - This ensures ease of processing and improves the efficiency of the Q&A system.

5. **Removal of Headers, Footers, and Page Numbers**
   - Completely eliminate all headers and footers from the document.
   - Ensure that page numbers, if present, are also removed to maintain a clean data structure.

6. **Exclusion of Improperly Imported Graphics**
   - Use the tag '#1' to indicate and exclude tables, figures, or any graphics that have not been imported accurately.

7. **Conversion to Pandas Dataframe**
   - Utilize appropriate Python libraries, such as `PyPDF2` or `PDFMiner`, to extract the text content from the PDF.
   - Transform this extracted content into a Pandas dataframe using the Python Pandas library.
   - Ensure that the dataframe structure aligns with the requirements of the targeted Q&A system.

8. **Validation**
   - Before feeding the dataframe into the Q&A system, validate the content to ensure accuracy and completeness.
   - Rectify any discrepancies identified during the validation process.

**Note:** Always maintain a backup of the original PDF document to safeguard against data loss during the conversion process.
